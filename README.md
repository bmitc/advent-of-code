# Advent of Code

 Solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in various languages, primarily functional in nature. Currently, solutions are just in Elixir but other possibilities may be F#, Racket, or Prolog. The likelihood of an imperative or mainly OOP language appearing like C, C++, Python, C#, Java, etc. is extremely low if not zero.
 
 The approach here is generally domain-driven design. Solutions are modeled after the problem descriptions and tend to avoid clever tricks in favor of being explicit, clear, maintainable, etc. Read the introduction in [advent_of_code_2022.livemd](2022/elixir/advent_of_code_2022.livemd) for more details of this approach.

For languages like Elixir and F#, notebooks will be used. For Elixir, the notebook solution is [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/). While there are no uploads in F# yet, the solution would be .NET Polyglot Notebooks using [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) and the [Polyglot Notebooks Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode).
